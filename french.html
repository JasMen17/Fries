    <h2>STEPS</h2>
    
    <p>
        I found that the best way to use the cutter is to slice 
        off maybe a half inch from one end of the potato. This will 
        give you a nice flat surface area to get the potato to adhere 
        to the prongs.
        Steak Fries</p>
        
        <p>Once the potatoes are cut, fill a large bowl or measuring cup with
         the hottest water you can get out of your tap. Add the potatoes to 
         the hot water and let them soak for 15-20 minutes. There are two reasons 
         we're doing this: crispier fries AND they cook faster in the oil later 
         since they're cooking a little now.</p>
        
        <p>Add your spices and flour into a large bag. Shake it well until it's 
        all combined. Now you can start adding water. A little less than one 
        cup gave me a great consistency. You want it to be a fairly thin batter.</p>
        
        <p>When the fries are done soaking, pull them out by the handfuls, shake 
        off the excess water and dump them in the batter bag. (You might need to 
        break up some of the longer spirals!) Shake the bag and massage it until 
        everything is nicely coated.</p>
        
        <p>You'll be frying them for 3-5 minutes in 350 F oil.</p>
