<h2>!History!</h2>

<img src="images/history.jpeg" width="400px">

<p>It is believed that Belgians were the first to begin the process of frying strips of 
    potatoes, at some time between the late 17th and early 18th century. Legend has it that 
    the poor villagers of Meuse subsisted on a diet of fish caught in the local river, which 
    they would then fry before eating. When the river would freeze over each winter and fishing 
    was not to be had, the potato became a stand in for the fish and the earliest iteration 
    of French fries was born.</p>

    <p>
        This explanation is not without its detractors, however, 
    as both France and Spain claim the French fry and it’s subsequent rise 
    to prominence are the results of their own culinary contributions. In any 
    case, in the United States the term “French fry” was alluded to when, in 1802, 
    Thomas Jefferson requested “potatoes served in the French manner” to accompany a 
    White House meal. By 1856, the term “French fried potatoes” was being used in print, 
    first and most notably in an E. Warren cookbook. The term worked its way into English 
    lexicon and the unpretentious side dish began its ascent from humble serving suggestion 
    to culinary legend.</p>
    
    <p>
        Today, French fries continue to be a prolific 
    side dish all around the world.</p>

    <h2>BUT WHY THE POPULARITY?</h2>
    

    <p>
    So why are French fries so popular? Certainly there are other side 
    dishes that would pair well with a protein. While speculative, it is 
    believed that French fries first gained a following in Europe, popularized 
    by dishes including the aforementioned steak frites and moules-frites. 
    Subsequently, French fries became popular with American soldiers stationed 
    overseas during World War I. When they returned home, they sought their new 
    favorite snack to no avail. At this time, however, America was witnessing the 
    renaissance of the modern fast food restaurant. Inexpensive to prepare and with 
    an already established clientele, White Castle began offering French fries with 
    their hamburgers. The rest, as they say, is history.
